   OBJECTIVE:  

   Navigate through three worlds (Water, Land, Space) while avoiding stationary/moving obstacles and collecting as many
   mini-cubes as possible. The token movement behaviour and obstacles differ in the various worlds:

      Water - With no user input, the token will remain in the same location relative to console boundaries. Obstacles
      include sharks, octopuses, coral, and seaweed.
      Land -  With no user input or only horizontal input, the token will "fall" to the bottom of the console. Obstacles
      include birds, bats, rocks, and trees.
      Space - With no user input, the token will continue to move in the last commanded direction. Obstacles include comets,
      asteroids, etc.

   Colliding with obstacles results in token death and colliding with mini-cubes results in points added to the total score.
   Try to collect as many mini-cubes as you can to achieve the highest score. Shots can be fired to destroy obstacles.

   GAME CONTROLS:

   Command the token to move in various directions using the following keys:
   
      w or up arrow - up
      s or down arrow - down
      a or left arrow - left
      d or right arrow - right
      spacebar - fire shot

   In a single player game mode, the player will have access to all game controls. In a two player game mode, player 1 has
   up, down, and fire shots control and player 2 has left, right, and fire shots control.

   SCORE:  

   Collect as many mini-cubes as possible. Each mini-cube collected is worth 10 points.
